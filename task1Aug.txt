// Install Redis (I will share a video to install Redis on windows)


1. Your company is building an e-commerce website with a high number of read operations for product details. Would Redis be a suitable solution for caching product details? Why or why not?
Answer: Yes!
- Reduces the load on database
- Since, its in memory operation is much faster
- It can be used as a data store for building recommendation system as where I can cache the frequent products or the most popular products within a specific geographical location.

2. You are designing a logging system for a large-scale application that requires storing and querying large amounts of log data over time. Would Redis be a good choice for this system? Explain your reasoning.
Answer: No!
- Redis is an in-memory database so it is limited by the amount of memory available RAM
- Cost of application would be very high.
- Complex opertations on heavy data is not possible
- In the case of point of failure, all our data inside would be gone.

3. A financial application requires strong consistency for transaction records. Would Redis be appropriate as the primary datastore? Why or why not?
Answer: No! (I will use it as a secondary data store with a very small memory life)
- Memory Constraints
- Cannot afford point of failures in financial apps
