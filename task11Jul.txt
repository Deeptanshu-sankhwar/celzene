Frontend:
1. Create the UI for signup/login
2. Create a UI for starting the game which shall display me 10 questions and I need to select one option as my answer within time limit of 60 seconds.
3. If I fail to answer within 60 seconds, my point would not be counted and I will immediately move to the next question.
4. When my 10 questions are over, I will see a summary of what questions did I answer correctly and which ones were wrong, alongwith my final score.
5. In my user profile, I can see all the list of games that I have played and my scores in each of them, alongwith the date and time at which they were played.
